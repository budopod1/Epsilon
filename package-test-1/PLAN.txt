PLAN FOR PACKAGING:
* make EPSLSPEC its own class
* builder.Build should output BuildInfo, which is also passed to builder.ToExecutable with all required info
    * BuildInfo contians:
        * primary EPSLSPEC
        * clang-options
        * dependencies that weren't linked (eg when output-type=package)
    * change so that Builder doesn't store this information
* when output-type=package:
    * don't link to builtins
    * don't link to an files not in project itself
    * clone EPSLSPEC of the package's entry file:
        * replace dependencies with all project dependencies that weren't linked
