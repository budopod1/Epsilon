TODO:
* before modules merge:
    * make structs work across files (eg if A imports B which imports C, where C defines a struct, and a function from B returns that struct, then A shouldn't crash when calling that function)
* after modules merge:
    * add safe array access and safe unwrap
    * struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
    * struct subclassing
