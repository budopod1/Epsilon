TODO:
* `Matrix` type?
* `Map` type
* serialization and complete compilation of `given`s
* serialization and complete compilation of `Poly` types_
* add way to apply operation to every element of array (like Linq Select)
* add option for string constants to be statically allocated
* top tracking so we can alloca instead of malloc
* self host LLVMIR section?
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* add `.so` compilation target
* add `.o` compilation target
* fix package, llvm-ll, and llvm-bc compilation targets
* add `Struct` type that's treated as a superclass of all structs
* add ability to import C methods and structs without having to write an EPSLSPEC
* cache `.o` files instead of `.bc` or `.ll` files because they'll be quicker to link
* save the OptimizationLevel in EPSLCACHE, and DONTLOAD cached files when it changes
