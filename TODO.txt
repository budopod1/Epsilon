TODO:
* `Matrix` type?
* `Map` type
* serialization and complete compilation of `given`s
* serialization and complete compilation of `Poly` types_
* add way to apply operation to every element of array (like Linq Select)
* add option for string constants to be statically allocated
* top tracking so we can alloca instead of malloc
* self host LLVMIR section
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* add `Struct` type that's treated as a superclass of all structs
* add `ObjectGenSubflags` (passed to both `clang` (when producing an object file, or going through an object file) and `llc`)
* figure out a better solution for CmdUtils locating runcommand.so
