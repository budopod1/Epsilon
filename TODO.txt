TODO:
* add ability to load compiler modules at runtime, enabling:
  * packages that contain `Matrix` and `Map` types
* @value annotation for structs that allows them to be treated as value types
* add way to apply operation to every element of array (like Linq's `.Select()`)
* lifetime analysis to eliminate ref counting ops and use stack allocs instead of heap allocs when possible
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* fix scoping rules: don't allow access to variables before their first definition
* update docs
* add support for a @private annotation
