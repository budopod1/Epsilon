TODO:
* `Matrix` type?
* `Map` type
* remove `make_range_array`
* intermediate results should be stored in their own folder
* top tracking so we can alloca instead of malloc
* add safe array access
* function annotations (the Java kind of annotation)
    * @cname annotation which specifies function ID (underlying symbol name)
* make Builder static?
* self host LLVMIR section?
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* struct subclassing
