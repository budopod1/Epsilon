TODO:
* lifetime analysis to eliminate ref counting ops and use stack allocs instead of heap allocs when possible
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* Epsilon 1.0
  * @value annotation for structs that allows them to be treated as value types
  * fix scoping rules: don't allow access to variables before their first definition
  * add way to apply operation to every element of array
  * add ability to load compiler modules at runtime, enabling:
    * packages that contain `Matrix` and `Map` types
  * figure out NaN and infinity (are they keywords, globals, functions, provided by a module?)
  * make globals verify they have a valid type
