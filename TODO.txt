TODO:
* `Matrix` type?
* `Map` type
* serialization and complete compilation of `Poly` types_
* add way to apply operation to every element of array (like Linq Select)
* lifetime analysis to eliminate rec counting ops and use stack allocs instead of heap allocs when possible
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* add `Struct` type that's treated as a superclass of all structs
* File should have custom destructor that calls `close`
* update docs
* add Windows support
