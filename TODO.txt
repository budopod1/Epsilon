TODO:
* add safe array access and safe unwrap
* change factor that determines script vs project mode to be > 1 user written file, not > 1 epsl file
* make structs work across files (eg if A imports B which imports C, where C defines a struct, and a function from B returns that struct, then A shouldn't crash when calling that function)
* make the default output filename's extention respect --output-type
