TODO:
* `Matrix` type?
* `Map` type
* serialization and complete compilation of `Poly` types_
* add way to apply operation to every element of array (like Linq Select)
* add option for string constants to be statically allocated
* top tracking so we can alloca instead of malloc
* self host LLVMIR section
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* add `Struct` type that's treated as a superclass of all structs
* add `ObjectGenSubflags` (passed to both `clang` (when producing an object file, or going through an object file) and `llc`)
* allow `switch` blocks with non-constant operands by converting them to Conditionals using the `equals` builtin (or equivalent)
* add new `at` method akin to JavaScript's, new `pop` method that always pops the last item (to eliminate `ack "len(gth)? ?- ?1"`)
* warn when the truth value is taken resulting in an always true truth value
* add `<Optional<Any>:optional>.expect<Str:fail_msg>` builtin akin to Rust's
* once custom struct destructors are supported, File and its associated functions shouldn't be builtins
* instead of mangling check_ref (and other autogenerated function) names, just make the functions private
* remove `_sub` from .gitignore once possible
* create C wrappers for functions that Epsilon calls if they take arguments that are ints of indeterminate size (eg. long, int, size_t)
