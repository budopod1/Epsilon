TODO:
* refactor most matchers into patternmatchers with custom pattern processors
* replace usage of Activator with direct instantiation
* investigate whether floats or doubles should be the default Q
* investiage whether DoubleConstant should be added (or maybe should replace FloatConstant)
* add logical and, or (maybe xor (would that be ^^?))
* add bitwise NOT
* stop bitwise boolean operators from casting types (require to arguments to be both the same type (which must be an integer type), then cast to the larger number of bits)
* add:
    if (!Type_.AreCompatible(o1.GetType_(), o2.GetType_())) {
        throw new SyntaxErrorException(
            \$"Cannot check equality of {o1.GetType_()} and {o2.GetType_()}"
        );
    }
    to all the comparison and equality operations
* add checks so that only numbers types_ (which includes bool) can be used in boolean operations (eg. And, Or...)
* change the:
        foreach (IToken token in program) {
            if (token is Function) {
                Function function = ((Function)token);
                Block block = function.GetBlock();
    structure into a system that will iterate over recursively nested blocks
* add support for nested blocks
* filter to prevent FunctionRuleMatchers with duplicate IPatternSegments
* add negation
* add better SyntaxError messages
