TODO:
* refactor most matchers into patternmatchers with custom pattern processors
* replace some usage of Activator with direct instantiation
* stop bitwise boolean operators from casting types (require to arguments to be both the same type (which must be an integer type), then cast to the larger number of bits)
* add:
    if (!Type_.AreCompatible(o1.GetType_(), o2.GetType_())) {
        throw new SyntaxErrorException(
            \$"Cannot check equality of {o1.GetType_()} and {o2.GetType_()}"
        );
    }
    to all the comparison and equality operations
* add checks so that only numbers types_ (which includes bool) can be used in logical operations (eg. And, Or...)
* filter to prevent FunctionRuleMatchers with duplicate IPatternSegments
* add better SyntaxError messages
* add comments
