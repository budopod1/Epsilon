TODO:
* split `FunctionCall` into `FunctionCall` and `VoidFunctionCall` tokens, the later of which does not implement IValueType
* remove `Unknown` type_
* make `File` a non-nullable type_
* `Matrix` type?
* top tracking so we can alloca instead of malloc
* add safe array access
* self host LLVMIR section?
* string interpolation
* struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
* struct subclassing
