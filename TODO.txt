TODO:
* improve messages when an invalid EPSLSPEC shape is recieved
* update documentation
* deal with structs that share the same name while coming from different files that do not, directly or indirectly, import each other
* reduce number of conversions between lists and hashsets when dealing with the base types_
* add caching of compiled .ll files
* seperating function id from the function called so multiple functions can call the same underlying function
