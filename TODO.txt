TODO:
* before modules merge:
    * recompile files when struct dependencies change, or function signatures change
* after modules merge:
    * add safe array access and safe unwrap
    * struct bound methods: stringify, compare (maybe), (called on) free, is truthy, casting (maybe)
    * struct subclassing
